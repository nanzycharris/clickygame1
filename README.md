This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The Simpsons Clicky Game renders some of the characters to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.

Here's the link to the deployed app:
